Classic Minecraft Launcher.

This a unfinished project, recreating the original classic Minecraft launcher from 1.6 in Visual Studio.

Creator: GridLock

This is not a mod in any shape or form, It's just a unfinished recreation of the Minecraft Launcher.
We are going to code it so it actually starts Minecraft probably in the next update.
Keep a eye out on updates!
